           <p>Actually I love more than on hobby. But main hobby is as usual playing cricket.Since my childhood I've too much interest about cricket.It seems like me that it is the best thing I've ever did. Whenever I play cricket it gives me a enjoyable moment and I enjoy that moment in the field. Except playing cricket I also watch cricket matches.I never miss my country's match and also watch IPL,BPL,PSL and many other premium leagues.Besides this hobby I also have another hobby tthat is collecting bikes and cars pictures. Actually I'm very much fond of bikes and cars.And I like to ride bike and car. Whenever I ride I feel like I'm flying and I'm doing the best thing in my life.This is all about my hobbies and I like to do all of these things.</p>
